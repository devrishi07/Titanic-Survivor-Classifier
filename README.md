This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using basic machine learning models.

I built this project to practice data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### Features
- Handles missing values and categorical variables
- Trains and evaluates multiple models
- Compares accuracy and confusion matrix results

### What I learned
- How feature choices affect model performance
- Why accuracy alone can be misleading
